**Twitter Text Classification with Word Embeddings and Logistic Regression**

Description:
This GitHub repository contains code for a text classification task using Twitter data. The goal of this project is to classify tweets into relevant categories (in this case, disaster-related or not) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.

**Key Steps and Features:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The code begins by loading the training and testing datasets, which contain tweets along with their corresponding labels. It then performs various data preprocessing steps, including:
   - Converting text to lowercase
   - Removing URLs
   - Removing punctuation
   - Expanding common chat abbreviations
   - Tokenization
   - Removing stopwords
   - Lemmatization

2. **Word Embeddings:** Word embeddings are essential for NLP tasks. This code uses the Gensim library to train Word2Vec models on the preprocessed tweet data. These Word2Vec models learn vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships.

3. **Text Classification:** The heart of this project is text classification. It utilizes logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to classify tweets into disaster-related (target = 1) or not (target = 0). The classification is based on the tweet embeddings generated from the Word2Vec models.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The code includes training and evaluation steps, measuring the model's performance using accuracy metrics.

5. **GitHub Structure:** The repository is organized with clear folder structures for data, code, and model storage. It's designed for ease of use and understanding.

This project demonstrates how to preprocess and classify text data effectively, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in text classification tasks using Twitter data and Word2Vec embeddings.

Feel free to clone the repository, experiment with different datasets, or adapt the code for your specific text classification tasks. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
